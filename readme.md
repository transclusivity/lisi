because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty." — Donald E. Knuth*

Welcome to the LISI, or the Lia interface standard implementation!
This repository is just one of the gateways to Lia.
Its goal is to provide LIA's community with a standard, stable system that can be quickly set up and run any time a new
project is needed. For more information or to access the online copies of the em series of manuals, see the liason website [here](https://liason.bearblog.dev).

# 1. Why Lia?
> *“The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.” ― Alan Kay*

## 1.1 Values
prosocial, spreading knowledge
## 1.2 Intentions
creating something that can help people understand programming and how languages work
## 1.3 Criteria
what the language needs to be in order to fulfill those things

# 2. What is Lia?
> *"Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature,
but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary." — John N. Shutt*

## 2.1 models
everything is either a scalar or a list
models are placed in a context list for manipulation
## 2.2 messages
scalar messages are built ins, lists are user defined
messages have fields you fill out
## 2.3 modes
...
# 3. How do I use it?
> *"Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do." — Donald E. Knuth*

## 3.1 Installation and configuration
## 3.2 Using Lia and designing software
## 3.3 Modifying Lia and contributing

# 4. Q & A
> *“A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.” ― Alan J. Perlis*

# 5. Where do I go from here?
> *“What's in your hands I think and hope is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as
more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.” ― Alan J. Perlis*

Included in this repository are the Lia manuals. This collection  of manuals is divided into smaller, well specified *Accepted Form * or EMs.
These are meant to form the basis of the curriculum for teaching Lia. There are 4 included in the [manuals](manuals) directory:
- [EM-0](manuals/em-0.md): A manual for how Ems should be written and structured
- [EM-1](manuals/em-1.md): A user manual for those who wish to use the language
- [EM-2](manuals/em-2.md): A development standard for those who wish to join the development team and contribute
- [EM-3](manuals/em-3.md): A specification for those who aspire to implement the language, or one similar
