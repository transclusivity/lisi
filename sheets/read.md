I want this to create a cst, so that I have a representation of the syntax that can be pretty printed.
this means I need to operate on that representation or create some type of translator between the two

I am also not sure as to whether or not read should be incremental, but I do feel that the ability to call
the reader during the operation of the program will be very valuable
